These questions/exercises are hypothetical situations and we would like for you to provide the steps you would take for each.
Please answer to the best of your abilities with the time allotted.

# 1 
A support case was assigned to you and its priority is HIGH. The customer provided a brief description as follows:
> Hello,
>   I am trying to run my billing report, and it is very slow.  This makes it difficult to do my job.

Knowing that this is a high priority support request, what are the steps that you would take?

I would call the customer and ask if we could do a remote session. Next I would check any network connections, check any logs that would be associated with the system that is generating the billing report. I would let the customer know that I would be working on this issue until its resolved.




# 2 

A support case is assigned to you and the message is as follows:
> Hello,
>  We received a response from your API that says "Error: The codes that were provided are not supported by Myndshft."
>  What does this message mean?  Why wouldn't these be supported?

Tell us the steps you would take to investigate and/or respond to the client request.

I would first ask customer if they wanted to use a remote session to diagnose the issue with error codes with the API, then I would try to find out if it was any of the following errors.

Response Codes and Statuses
Code	Status	Description
200	OK	The request was successfully completed.
201	Created	A new resource was successfully created.
400	Bad Request	The request was invalid.
401	Unauthorized	The request did not include an authentication token or the authentication token was expired.

HTTP status codes can be grouped into five different categories, by looking at their first digit:

1xx - Informational

2xx - Success

3xx - Redirection

4xx - Client Error

5xx - Server Error

After a customer complains that they are getting "intermittent" failures, you do some investigating.  After reviewing some metrics, you notice that every other request to the system results in an error, and the others are successful.
Tell us what you would do next, how you might attempt to resolve it, etc.

If we are talking about a physical server I would be checking for logs that might be able to pinpoint if the customer is dealing with a hardware or network issue. There seems to be a pattern that this is happening on every other request. I would try to narrow down when the issue started how long this has been happening, if it was at the peek time of the day and what other system/ applications are running. I would let the customer know that I would doing everything I can to resolve their issue in a timely manner.

If you were hired to transport 1,000,000 ping-pong balls from Phoenix to L.A., how would you do it?  What questions would you have to make y our decisions?

Rent a large box truck and leaf vacume that would suck the ping-balls and blow them into the box truck, then transport the truck to the final destination and off load them into packing containers.
