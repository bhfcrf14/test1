These questions/exercises are hypothetical situations and we would like for you to provide the steps you would take for each.
Please answer to the best of your abilities with the time allotted.

# 1

A support case was assigned to you and its priority is HIGH. The customer provided a brief description as follows:
> Hello,
>   I am trying to run my billing report, and it is very slow.  This makes it difficult to do my job.

Knowing that this is a high priority support request, what are the steps that you would take?




# 2

A support case is assigned to you and the message is as follows:
> Hello,
>  We received a response from your API that says "Error: The codes that were provided are not supported by Myndshft."
>  What does this message mean?  Why wouldn't these be supported?

Tell us the steps you would take to investigate and/or respond to the client request.



#3

After a customer complains that they are getting "intermittent" failures, you do some investigating.  After reviewing some metrics, you notice that every other request to the system results in an error, and the others are successful.
Tell us what you would do next, how you might attempt to resolve it, etc.




#4

If you were hired to transport 1,000,000 ping-pong balls from Phoenix to L.A., how would you do it?  What questions would you have to make your decisions?
